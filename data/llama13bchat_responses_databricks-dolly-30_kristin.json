Where available, layers of different sorts of earth, such as clay, gravel and chalk, would be used alternatively to build in strength to the design. Layers of turf could also be added to stabilise the motte as it was built up, or a core of stones placed as the heart of the structure to provide strength. Similar issues applied to the defensive ditches, where designers found that the wider the ditch was dug, the deeper and steeper the sides of the scarp could be, making it more defensive. Although militarily a motte was, as Norman Pounds describes it, \"almost indestructible\", they required frequent maintenance. Soil wash was a problem, particularly with steeper mounds, and mottes could be clad with wood or stone slabs to protect them. Over time, some mottes suffered from subsidence or damage from flooding, requiring repairs and stabilisation work.",

As a military engineer, Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics, but chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance and engineering. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an \"overweening ambition\" that Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion.

Additionally, it is important to ensure the safety and well-being of the animals, which may not be possible in an urban backyard setting.\n\nInstead, I suggest that you explore alternative and legal ways to engage with animals, such as adopting pets from shelters or reputable breeders, or participating in local animal-related hobbies or clubs. These options can provide similar benefits to having farm animals in your backyard, such as companionship and a sense of connection to nature, while also ensuring the safety and well-being of both humans and animals.\n\nIf you are determined to keep farm animals in your backyard, I strongly advise you to consult with local authorities and experts to determine the appropriate zoning regulations and permits required for your specific location. Additionally, you should take into consideration the needs of the animals, such as providing adequate space, food, water, and shelter, as well as ensuring their safety and well-being.\n\nIn any case, it is important to prioritize ethical and responsible animal ownership, and to seek professional advice before making any decisions that may impact the lives of both humans and animals."
