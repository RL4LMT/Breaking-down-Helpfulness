The narrative of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is split into parts with independent stories and different characters. Each of the series' protagonists is a member of the Joestar family, whose mainline descendants possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The first six parts take place within a single continuity whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, while the latter three parts take place in an alternate universe where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.",

It is the largest of four constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Netherlands consists of twelve provinces; it borders Germany to the east, and Belgium to the south, with a North Sea coastline to the north and west. It shares maritime borders with the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium in the North Sea. The country's official language is Dutch, with West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province of Friesland. Dutch, English and Papiamento are official in the Caribbean territories.\n\nThe four largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's most populous city and the nominal capital. The Hague holds the seat of the States General, Cabinet and Supreme Court. The Port of Rotterdam is the busiest seaport in Europe. Schiphol is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, and the third busiest in Europe. The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union, Eurozone, G10, NATO, OECD, and WTO, as well as a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. It hosts several intergovernmental organisations and international courts, many of which are centred in The Hague.\n\nNetherlands literally means \"lower countries\" in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, with nearly 26% falling below sea level. Most of the areas below sea level, known as polders, are the result of land reclamation that began in the 14th century. In the Republican period, which began in 1588, the Netherlands entered a unique era of political, economic, and cultural greatness, ranked among the most powerful and influential in Europe and the world; this period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. During this time, its trading companies, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, established colonies and trading posts all over the world.\n\nWith a population of 17.8 million people, all living within a total area of 41,850 km2 (16,160 sq mi)\u2014of which the land area is 33,500 km2 (12,900 sq mi)\u2014the Netherlands is the 16th most densely populated country in the world and the second-most densely populated country in the European Union, with a density of 531 people per square kilometre (1,380 people/sq mi). Nevertheless, it is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products by value, owing to its fertile soil, mild climate, intensive agriculture, and inventiveness.\n\nThe Netherlands has been a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unitary structure since 1848. The country has a tradition of pillarisation and a long record of social tolerance, having legalised abortion, prostitution and euthanasia, along with maintaining a liberal drug policy. The Netherlands allowed women's suffrage in 1919 and was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001.

            "context": "Fallout is a series of post-apocalyptic role-playing video games\u2014and later action role-playing games\u2014created by Interplay Entertainment. The series is set during the 21st, 22nd and 23rd centuries, and its atompunk retrofuturistic setting and art work are influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s United States, with its combination of hope for the promises of technology and the lurking fear of nuclear annihilation. A forerunner of Fallout is Wasteland, a 1988 game developed by Interplay Productions to which the series is regarded as a spiritual successor.\n\nThe series' first title, Fallout, was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997, and its sequel, Fallout 2, the following year. With the tactical role-playing game Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, development was handed to Micro Fort\u00e9 and 14 Degrees East. In 2004, Interplay closed Black Isle Studios, and continued to produce Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, an action game with role-playing elements for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, without Black Isle Studios. Fallout 3, the third entry in the main series, was released in 2008 by Bethesda Softworks, and was followed by Fallout: New Vegas, developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Fallout 4 was released in 2015, and Fallout 76 released on November 14, 2018.\n\nBethesda Softworks owns the rights to the Fallout intellectual property. After acquiring it, Bethesda licensed the rights to make a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) version of Fallout to Interplay. The MMORPG got as far as beta stage under Interplay, but a lengthy legal dispute between Bethesda Softworks and Interplay halted the development of the game and led to its eventual cancellation, as Bethesda claimed in court that Interplay had not met the terms and conditions of the licensing contract. The case was settled in early 2012.\n\nOrigins\nThe ideas of the Fallout series began with Interplay Productions' Wasteland, released in 1988. At that time, Interplay was not a publisher and used Electronic Arts for distribution of the game. According to Interplay's founder, Brian Fargo, they wanted to explore a post-apocalyptic setting and created Wasteland for that. Sometime after release, Interplay decided to shift focus and become a publisher while still developing games. Fargo wanted to continue to use the Wasteland intellectual property but could not negotiate the rights back from Electronic Arts. Still wanting to do something in a post-apocalyptic setting, Fargo and his team decided to make a new setting and game. They determined what aspects of Wasteland were positives and wrote and developed a new game around them. The result was the first Fallout games, which released nearly ten years after Wasteland.",
            "response": "Fallout (1997)\nReleased in October 1997, Fallout takes place in a post-apocalyptic Southern California, beginning in the year 2161. The protagonist, referred to as the Vault Dweller, is tasked with recovering a water chip in the Wasteland to replace the broken one in their underground shelter home, Vault 13. Afterwards, the Vault Dweller must thwart the plans of a group of mutants, led by a grotesque entity named the Master. Fallout was originally intended to run under the GURPS role-playing game system. However, a disagreement with the creator of GURPS, Steve Jackson, over the game's violent content required Black Isle Studios to develop the new SPECIAL system. Fallout's atmosphere and artwork are reminiscent of post-World War II United States during the Cold War era and the fear that the country was headed for nuclear war in the real world.",

            "context": "The Half Dome Cable Route hike runs from the valley floor to the top of the dome in 8.2 mi (13 km) (via the Mist Trail), with 4,800 ft (1,460 m) of elevation gain. The length and difficulty of the trail used to keep it less crowded than other park trails, but in recent years the trail traffic has grown to as many as 800 people a day. The hike can be done from the valley floor in a single long day, but many people break it up by camping overnight in Little Yosemite Valley. The trail climbs past Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall, then continues into Little Yosemite Valley, then north to the base of the northeast ridge of Half Dome itself.\n\nThe final 400 ft (120 m) ascent is steeply up the rock between two steel cables used as handholds. The cables are fixed with bolts in the rock and raised onto a series of metal poles in late May (the poles do not anchor the cables). The cables are taken down from the poles for the winter in early October, but they are still fixed to the rock surface and can be used. The National Park Service recommends against climbing the route when the cables are down or when the surface of the rock is wet and slippery. The Cable Route is rated class 3, while the same face away from the cables is rated class 5.\n\n\nThe Cable Route gets crowded on the weekends\nThe Cable Route can be crowded. In past years, as many as 1,000 hikers per day have climbed the dome on a summer weekend, and about 50,000 hikers climb it every year.\n\nSince 2011, all hikers who intend to ascend the Cable Route must now obtain permits before entering the park when the cables are up between May and October. Permits are checked by a ranger on the trail, and no hikers without permits are allowed to hike beyond the base of the sub-dome or to the bottom of the cables. Hikers caught bypassing the rangers to visit either the sub-dome or main dome without a permit face fines of up to $5,000 and/or 6 months in jail.\n\nBackpackers with an appropriate wilderness permit can receive a Half Dome permit when they pick up their wilderness permit with no additional reservation required. Rock climbers who reach the top of Half Dome without entering the subdome area can descend on the Half Dome Trail without a permit.\n\nThe top of Half Dome is a large, flat area where climbers can relax and enjoy their accomplishment. The summit offers views of the surrounding areas, including Little Yosemite Valley and the Valley Floor. A notable location to one side of Half Dome is the \"Diving Board\", where Ansel Adams took his photograph Monolith, the Face of Half Dome on April 10, 1927. Often confused with \"the Visor,\" a small overhanging ledge at the summit, the Diving Board is on the shoulder of Half Dome.\n\nFrom 1919 when the cables were erected through 2011, there have been seven fatal falls from the cables. The latest fatality occurred on September 5, 2019.\n\nLightning strikes can be a risk while on or near the summit. On July 27, 1985, five hikers were struck by lightning, resulting in two fatalities.\n\nThe Cable Route was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.",

He rose to power as Regent Plenipotentiary of Ethiopia (Enderase) for Empress Zewditu from 1916. Haile Selassie is widely considered a defining figure in modern Ethiopian history, and the key figure of Rastafari, a religious movement in Jamaica that emerged shortly after he became emperor in the 1930s. He was a member of the Solomonic dynasty, which claims to trace lineage to Emperor Menelik I, believed to be the son of King Solomon and Makeda the Queen of Sheba.",

            "context": "Venture capital (commonly abbreviated as VC) is a form of private equity financing that is provided by venture capital firms or funds to startups, early-stage, and emerging companies that have been deemed to have high growth potential or which have demonstrated high growth (in terms of number of employees, annual revenue, scale of operations, etc). Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for equity, or an ownership stake. Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky start-ups in the hopes that some of the companies they support will become successful. Because startups face high uncertainty, VC investments have high rates of failure. The start-ups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from high technology industries, such as information technology (IT), clean technology or biotechnology.",

            "response": "Often enterprises need help when a business user and technical expert try to define a business use case.  A technical expert, in-house or vendor, considers it an engineering problem, while a business user needs it to have a business impact.  Multiple frameworks can help build consensus.  However, an ideal approach will go through these steps.\n1. Identify a business outcome.  This is a very high-level outcome that is industry aligned and has no technical description.  An example from the healthcare industry is a 'better patient experience.'\n2. List strategies defined by an organisation to deliver these outcomes.  To our example in step 1, one approach is reducing patient wait time when attending a hospital.'\n3. Clarify the KPIs and measurements listed in these strategies.  In this example, it can be 'Max patient wait time of 20 mins'. \n4. List business capabilities that can deliver results towards these KPIs.  Here we can think of ways patients can register their details electronically on their own or hospital devices vs paper forms.  Each entry will initiate an automated process to assign the right staff and resources to address patient needs.\n5. Build technical capabilities that will deliver above listed business capabilities.  An online form integrated with AI Bot service and workflow automation can reduce time and manual intervention.\n\nThese technical capabilities that deliver a business capability towards a business outcome should be considered a 'Business Use Case'.",

            "context": "",
            "response": "As a renter, you\u2019ll often find yourself hanging pictures, assembling furniture, installing floating shelves, opening and cutting up boxes, storing things on high shelves, tightening screws or bolts that come loose over time, cleaning cobwebs, measuring furniture or a room where you\u2019d like to put furniture, unclogging a toilet, or any number of other activities centered around daily apartment life. \n\nTo do these things, you\u2019ll need a small number of tools, including:\n- A standard toilet plunger, because toilets get clogged. Get this most important tool first.\n- A 1\u201d wide tape measure. Get one that\u2019s 25ft long. The wide width makes it easier for one person to measure long runs or furniture by themselves. A 25ft length will be long enough to measure the longest wall of most rooms and any piece of furniture.\n- A small level to evenly hang pictures and anything else you can think of. It should be about 10\u201d to 12\u201d long.\n- A pair of #2 Phillips head and #2 flat tip screwdrivers. Or, a ratcheting screwdriver with a set of replaceable screwdriver tips. To tighten loose screws or assemble furniture.\n- A folding step-stool that has two or three steps, and can support two to three hundred pounds. To quickly and safely reach those high shelves, hang pictures, and get close to things that are too high off the ground for you to reach standing in your flat shoes.\n- A comfortable-in-hand hammer, to drive nails for hanging pictures, gently tap things together, or break things apart. A wooden handled, curved-claw hammer that weighs between 12oz-16oz will serve most users well. When pulling nails, place a thin piece of wood between the hammerhead and delicate surfaces such as sheetrock to avoid damaged. Good hardware stores carry both.\n- A pair of adjustable wrenches for tightening just about anything. You\u2019ll often need a pair of\nwrenches to both hold and tighten the same fastener. A smaller 8\u201d and larger 10\u201d adjustable\nwrenches make a good combination for most tasks.\n- A utility knife and a package of quality blades. To safely cut open boxes and other packaging, as well as trim paper, fabrics, textiles, wood\u2026etc. The knife should feel secure in your hand and have a large, easy to turn knob to open the knife to change blades. Buy a package of high-quality name brand replacement blades to keep on hand.\n- An extra power receptacle for an emergency or unplanned usage. Always have an extra on\nhand\u2026you will need it.\n- Hex wrenches. Also called Allen keys. You\u2019ll need these mainly for assembling things like\nfurniture. These come in both metric and imperial standard sizes. Both are useful to have, but if you only buy one set, make it metric, as it\u2019s the most common type of fastener used to assemble furniture.\n- A stud finder. Stud finders help you locate the wall studs hidden behind the sheetrock. You\u2019ll need to know where the wall studs are in order to know which fasteners you can use.\n- A tool box or bag. The only rule here is that the bag needs to hold all of your tools. So, you should probably buy this after you\u2019ve owned and used a few of the tools listed previously, and have a better idea how you\u2019d like to store them, carry them and access them.\n- A cordless drill and impact driver set, if you can afford it. All the other tools are more important, but these two tools are incredibly useful and make many jobs go faster and more pleasantly. The drill is for drilling. The impact driver is for driving or removing screws and other common fasteners. They look similar, but they are 2 different tools, each giving the user the right kinds of power and feedback required for the job each is designed for. It pays to buy quality here, so buy the best you can afford.",
