They are regarded as the most influential band of all time and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.",
        "response": "ed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to EMI Records and achieving their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage sometimes informally referred to as a \"fifth Beatle\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the untenable nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. At this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they also increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists and some partial reunions have occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They are the most successful act in the history of the US Billboard charts. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest artists in history. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.",

Hale, 28, was killed by two Metropolitan Nashville Police Department officers responding to the incident.\n\nHale was initially reported to be a woman and referred to by his birth name by police. Later, it was confirmed that Hale was a trans man who went by the name Aiden and used he/him pronouns.\n\nHale drove a Honda Fit to the school, arriving at 9:54 a.m. CDT and parking it in the lot.

His friend called a crisis hotline before contacting the Davidson County Sheriff's Office at 10:13.\n\nAt 10:11, Hale shot through a set of glass side doors and entered the building. He was armed with two rifles and a pistol. At 10:13, police received a call about an active shooter. He walked across the second floor of the school before opening fire. He fired into several classrooms; no one in the classrooms was injured because the teachers had fortified doors and sheltered the students. The police first arrived at the school at 10:24. A teacher told an officer that the students were in lockdown and two were missing.\n\nOfficers entered the building at 10:25 and they searched each room for Hale. They heard gunshots coming from the second floor. Five Metro Nashville police officers went upstairs and saw him in a lobby area, firing through a window at arriving police vehicles.

        "context": "Tiramisu appears to have been invented in the 1960s, but where and when exactly is unclear.\n\nThe recipe for tiramisu is not found in cookbooks before the 1960s. It is mentioned in a Sydney Morning Herald restaurant column published in 1978. It is not mentioned in encyclopedias and dictionaries of the 1970s, first appearing in an Italian dictionary in 1980, and in English in 1982. It is mentioned in a 1983 cookbook devoted to cooking of the Veneto.\n\nObituaries for the restaurateur Ado Campeol (1928\u20132021) reported that it was invented at his restaurant Le Beccherie in Treviso on 24 December 1969 by his wife Alba di Pillo (1929\u20132021) and the pastry chef Roberto Linguanotto. The dish was added to its menu in 1972. Accounts by Carminantonio Iannaccone claim the tiramisu sold at Le Beccherie was made by him in his bakery, created on 24 December 1969.\n\nIt has been claimed that tiramisu has aphrodisiac effects and was concocted by a 19th-century Treviso brothel madam, as the Accademia Del Tiramis\u00f9 explains, to \"solve the problems they may have had with their conjugal duties on their return to their wives\".\n\nThere is evidence of a \"Tiremes\u00f9\" semi-frozen dessert served by the Vetturino restaurant in Pieris, in the Friuli Venezia Giulia, since 1938. This may be the name's origin, while the recipe for Tiramisu may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, Zuppa Inglese. Others claim it was created towards the end of the 17th century in Siena in honour of Grand Duke Cosimo III.\n\nOn 29 July 2017, Tiramisu was entered by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies on the list of traditional Friulian and Giulian agri-food products in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. In 2013, Luca Zaia, governor of Veneto sought European Union Protected Status certification for the dessert, based on the ingredients used in 1970, so substitute ingredients, such as strawberries, could not be used in a dish called tiramisu",
        "response": "Tiramisu with strawberries can not be called Tiramisu. Only with chocolate.",
        "category": "closed_qa",
        "generated_response": "\nBased on the provided information, it is difficult to determine which version of tiramisu is better, as both chocolate and strawberry versions have their own unique history and characteristics. However, if we had to choose based on the original recipe and traditional preparation method, then chocolate tiramisu would be the better option.\n\nThe traditional recipe for tiramisu calls for ladyfingers soaked in coffee and liqueur, layered with a mixture of mascarpone cheese and whipped cream, and topped with cocoa powder or chocolate shavings. This recipe has been consistent since the dish was first created in the 1960s, and it is this version that has been recognized as a traditional Friulian and Giulian agri-food product by the Italian government.\n\nWhile strawberry tiramisu may be a delicious variation of the original recipe, it is not a traditional or authentic version of the dish. The use of strawberries in tiramisu is a more recent innovation, and it does not have the same historical roots as the chocolate version.\n\nTherefore, if you want to experience the true flavor and tradition of tiramisu, then chocolate tiramisu would be the better choice. However, if you prefer strawberries or want to try a new twist on the classic dessert, then strawberry tiramisu is also a delicious option."

        "category": "brainstorming",
        "generated_response": " The question of whether Jesus was an actual person or a mythical figure is a topic of ongoing debate among historians, scholars, and religious figures. While there are different perspectives and interpretations, the majority of scholars and historians agree that Jesus of Nazareth did exist as a historical figure.\n\nThere are several reasons for this consensus:\n\n1. Historical sources: The New Testament accounts of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection provide the earliest and most extensive historical records of his existence. While the Gospels were written decades after Jesus' death, they are based on earlier sources and eyewitness accounts that have been considered reliable by historians. Additionally, non-Christian sources like the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus and the Roman historian Tacitus also mention Jesus or the early Christian movement, which further supports his historical existence.\n2. Archaeological evidence: Excavations in Nazareth and other locations have uncovered artifacts and inscriptions that support the historical accuracy of some of the details mentioned in the New Testament accounts of Jesus' life. While these findings do not directly prove Jesus' existence, they contribute to the overall historical context in which he lived.\n3. The consistency of early Christian beliefs: The belief in Jesus' historicity was central to the early Christian communities, and their conviction about his existence and message was a driving force behind the rapid spread of Christianity. It is unlikely that the early Christians would have fabricated such a figure without any historical basis, especially given the persecution and hardships they faced for their beliefs.\n4. The coherence of the Gospel accounts: While the Gospels contain differences and contradictions, they also share a consistent message about Jesus' life, teachings, death, and resurrection. This consistency suggests that the accounts are based on a common historical core, rather than purely mythical or legendary material.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be debates about the specific details of Jesus' life and teachings, the majority of scholars and historians agree that Jesus of Nazareth did exist as an actual person in history. The cumulative weight of historical sources, archaeological evidence, the consistency of early Christian beliefs, and the coherence of the Gospel accounts all support this conclusion."
