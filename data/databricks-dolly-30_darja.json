            "context": "On March 27, 2023, a mass shooting occurred at The Covenant School, a private Presbyterian Church in America parochial school in the Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee. Local resident and former student of the school Aiden Hale (formerly Audrey Elizabeth Hale) killed three children and three adults. Hale, 28, was killed by two Metropolitan Nashville Police Department officers responding to the incident.\n\nHale was initially reported to be a woman and referred to by his birth name by police. Later, it was confirmed that Hale was a trans man who went by the name Aiden and used he/him pronouns.\n\nHale drove a Honda Fit to the school, arriving at 9:54 a.m. CDT and parking it in the lot. At 9:57, Hale sent an Instagram message to an old friend saying an earlier post he made was \"basically a suicide note\" and that he planned to die that day. His friend called a crisis hotline before contacting the Davidson County Sheriff's Office at 10:13.\n\nAt 10:11, Hale shot through a set of glass side doors and entered the building. He was armed with two rifles and a pistol. At 10:13, police received a call about an active shooter. He walked across the second floor of the school before opening fire. He fired into several classrooms; no one in the classrooms was injured because the teachers had fortified doors and sheltered the students. The police first arrived at the school at 10:24. A teacher told an officer that the students were in lockdown and two were missing.\n\nOfficers entered the building at 10:25 and they searched each room for Hale. They heard gunshots coming from the second floor. Five Metro Nashville police officers went upstairs and saw him in a lobby area, firing through a window at arriving police vehicles. Two of the officers fired four times each killing him at 10:27, 14 minutes after the initial 911 call was made",

            "context": "Systems development life cycle\n\nArticle\nTalk\nRead\nEdit\nView history\n\nTools\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nThis article is about systems development life cycle. For the IBM's computer communication protocol, see Synchronous Data Link Control.\n\nModel of the software development life cycle, highlighting the maintenance phase\nIn systems engineering, information systems and software engineering, the systems development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the application development life cycle, is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. The SDLC concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination of both. There are usually six stages in this cycle: requirement analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.\n\nOverview\nA systems development life cycle is composed of distinct work phases that are used by systems engineers and systems developers to deliver information systems. Like anything that is manufactured on an assembly line, an SDLC aims to produce high-quality systems that meet or exceed expectations, based on requirements, by delivering systems within scheduled time frames and cost estimates. Computer systems are complex and often link components with varying origins. Various SDLC methodologies have been created, such as waterfall, spiral, agile, rapid prototyping, incremental, and synchronize and stabilize.\n\nSDLC methodologies fit within a flexibility spectrum ranging from agile to iterative to sequential. Agile methodologies, such as XP and Scrum, focus on lightweight processes that allow for rapid changes. Iterative methodologies, such as Rational Unified Process and dynamic systems development method, focus on stabilizing project scope and iteratively expanding or improving products. Sequential or big-design-up-front (BDUF) models, such as waterfall, focus on complete and correct planning to guide larger projects and limit risks to successful and predictable results.[citation needed] Anamorphic development is guided by project scope and adaptive iterations.\n\nIn project management a project can include both a project life cycle (PLC) and an SDLC, during which somewhat different activities occur. According to Taylor (2004), \"the project life cycle encompasses all the activities of the project, while the systems development life cycle focuses on realizing the product requirements\".\n\nSDLC is not a methodology per se, but rather a description of the phases that a methodology should address. The list of phases is not definitive, but typically includes planning, analysis, design, build, test, implement, and maintenance/support. In the Scrum framework, for example, one could say a single user story goes through all the phases of the SDLC within a two-week sprint. By contrast the waterfall methodology, where every business requirement[citation needed] is translated into feature/functional descriptions which are then all implemented typically over a period of months or longer.[citation needed]\n\nHistory\nAccording to Elliott & Strachan & Radford (2004), SDLC \"originated in the 1960s, to develop large scale functional business systems in an age of large scale business conglomerates. Information systems activities revolved around heavy data processing and number crunching routines\".\n\nThe structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM) was produced for the UK government Office of Government Commerce in the 1980s. Ever since, according to Elliott (2004), \"the traditional life cycle approaches to systems development have been increasingly replaced with alternative approaches and frameworks, which attempted to overcome some of the inherent deficiencies of the traditional SDLC\".\n\nModels\n\nA ten-phase version of the systems development life cycle\nSDLC provides a set of phases/steps/activities for system designers and developers to follow. Each phase builds on the results of the previous one. Not every project requires that the phases be sequential. For smaller, simpler projects, phases may be combined/overlap.\n\nWaterfall\nThe oldest and best known is the waterfall model, which uses a linear sequence of steps. Waterfall has different varieties. One variety is as follows:\n\nPreliminary analysis\nConduct with a preliminary analysis, consider alternative solutions, estimate costs and benefits, and submit a preliminary plan with recommendations.\n\nConduct preliminary analysis: Identify the organization's objectives and define the nature and scope of the project. Ensure that the project fits with the objectives.\nConsider alternative solutions: Alternatives may come from interviewing employees, clients, suppliers, and consultants, as well as competitive analysis.\nCost-benefit analysis: Analyze the costs and benefits of the project.\nSystems analysis, requirements definition\nDecompose project goals[clarification needed] into defined functions and operations. This involves gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems, and recommending changes. Analyze end-user information needs and resolve inconsistencies and incompleteness:\n\nCollect facts: Obtain end-user requirements by document review, client interviews, observation, and questionnaires.\nScrutinize existing system(s): Identify pros and cons.\nAnalyze the proposed system: Find solutions to issues and prepare specifications, incorporating appropriate user proposals.\nSystems design\nAt this step, desired features and operations are detailed, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode, and other deliverables.\n\nDevelopment\nWrite the code.\n\nIntegration and testing\nAssemble the modules in a testing environment. Check for errors, bugs, and interoperability.\n\nAcceptance, installation, deployment\nPut the system into production. This may involve training users, deploying hardware, and loading information from the prior system.\n\nMaintenance\nMonitor the system to assess its ongoing fitness. Make modest changes and fixes as needed.\n\nEvaluation\nThe system and the process are reviewed. Relevant questions include whether the newly implemented system meets requirements and achieves project goals, whether the system is usable, reliable/available, properly scaled and fault-tolerant. Process checks include review of timelines and expenses, as well as user acceptance.\n\nDisposal\nAt end of life, plans are developed for discontinuing the system and transitioning to its replacement. Related information and infrastructure must be repurposed, archived, discarded, or destroyed, while appropriately protecting security.\n\nIn the following diagram, these stages of the are divided into ten steps, from definition to creation and modification of IT work products:\n\nSystems analysis and design\nSystems analysis and design (SAD) can be considered a meta-development activity, which serves to set the stage and bound the problem. SAD can help balance competing high-level requirements. SAD interacts with distributed enterprise architecture, enterprise I.T. Architecture, and business architecture, and relies heavily on concepts such as partitioning, interfaces, personae and roles, and deployment/operational modeling to arrive at a high-level system description. This high-level description is then broken down into the components and modules which can be analyzed, designed, and constructed separately and integrated to accomplish the business goal. SDLC and SAD are cornerstones of full life cycle product and system planning.\n\nObject-oriented analysis and design\nObject-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) is the process of analyzing a problem domain to develop a conceptual model that can then be used to guide development. During the analysis phase, a programmer develops written requirements and a formal vision document via interviews with stakeholders.\n\nThe conceptual model that results from OOAD typically consists of use cases, and class and interaction diagrams. It may also include a user interface mock-up.\n\nAn output artifact does not need to be completely defined to serve as input of object-oriented design; analysis and design may occur in parallel. In practice the results of one activity can feed the other in an iterative process.\n\nSome typical input artifacts for OOAD:\n\nConceptual model: A conceptual model is the result of object-oriented analysis. It captures concepts in the problem domain. The conceptual model is explicitly independent of implementation details.\nUse cases: A use case is a description of sequences of events that, taken together, complete a required task. Each use case provides scenarios that convey how the system should interact with actors (users). Actors may be end users or other systems. Use cases may further elaborated using diagrams. Such diagrams identify the actor and the processes they perform.\nSystem Sequence Diagram: A System Sequence diagrams (SSD) is a picture that shows, for a particular use case, the events that actors generate, their order, including inter-system events.\nUser interface document: Document that shows and describes the user interface.\nData model: A data model describes how data elements relate to each other. The data model is created before the design phase. Object-oriented designs map directly from the data model. Relational designs are more involved.\nSystem lifecycle\nThe system lifecycle is a view of a system or proposed system that addresses all phases of its existence to include system conception, design and development, production and/or construction, distribution, operation, maintenance and support, retirement, phase-out, and disposal.\n\nConceptual design\nThe conceptual design stage is the stage where an identified need is examined, requirements for potential solutions are defined, potential solutions are evaluated, and a system specification is developed. The system specification represents the technical requirements that will provide overall guidance for system design. Because this document determines all future development, the stage cannot be completed until a conceptual design review has determined that the system specification properly addresses the motivating need.\n\nKey steps within the conceptual design stage include:\n\nNeed identification\nFeasibility analysis\nSystem requirements analysis\nSystem specification\nConceptual design review\nPreliminary system design\nDuring this stage of the system lifecycle, subsystems that perform the desired system functions are designed and specified in compliance with the system specification. Interfaces between subsystems are defined, as well as overall test and evaluation requirements. At the completion of this stage, a development specification is produced that is sufficient to perform detailed design and development.\n\nKey steps within the preliminary design stage include:\n\nFunctional analysis\nRequirements allocation\nDetailed trade-off studies\nSynthesis of system options\nPreliminary design of engineering models\nDevelopment specification\nPreliminary design review\nFor example, as the system analyst of Viti Bank, you have been tasked to examine the current information system. Viti Bank is a fast-growing bank in Fiji. Customers in remote rural areas are finding difficulty to access the bank services. It takes them days or even weeks to travel to a location to access the bank services. With the vision of meeting the customers' needs, the bank has requested your services to examine the current system and to come up with solutions or recommendations of how the current system can be provided to meet its needs.\n\nDetail design and development\nThis stage includes the development of detailed designs that brings initial design work into a completed form of specifications. This work includes the specification of interfaces between the system and its intended environment, and a comprehensive evaluation of the systems logistical, maintenance and support requirements. The detail design and development is responsible for producing the product, process and material specifications and may result in substantial changes to the development specification.\n\nKey steps within the detail design and development stage include:\n\nDetailed design\nDetailed synthesis\nDevelopment of engineering and prototype models\nRevision of development specification\nProduct, process, and material specification\nCritical design review\nProduction and construction\nDuring the production and/or construction stage the product is built or assembled in accordance with the requirements specified in the product, process and material specifications, and is deployed and tested within the operational target environment. System assessments are conducted in order to correct deficiencies and adapt the system for continued improvement.\n\nKey steps within the product construction stage include:\n\nProduction and/or construction of system components\nAcceptance testing\nSystem distribution and operation\nOperational testing and evaluation\nSystem assessment\nUtilization and support\nOnce fully deployed, the system is used for its intended operational role and maintained within its operational environment.\n\nKey steps within the utilization and support stage include:\n\nSystem operation in the user environment\nChange management\nSystem modifications for improvement\nSystem assessment\nPhase-out and disposal\nEffectiveness and efficiency of the system must be continuously evaluated to determine when the product has met its maximum effective lifecycle. Considerations include: Continued existence of operational need, matching between operational requirements and system performance, feasibility of system phase-out versus maintenance, and availability of alternative systems.\n\nPhases\n\nThis section includes a list of references, related reading, or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please help to improve this section by introducing more precise citations. (January 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nSystem investigation\nDuring this step, current priorities that would be affected and how they should be handled are considered. A feasibility study determines whether creating a new or improved system is appropriate. This helps to estimate costs, benefits, resource requirements, and specific user needs.\n\nThe feasibility study should address operational, financial, technical, human factors, and legal/political concerns.\n\nAnalysis\nThe goal of analysis is to determine where the problem is. This step involves decomposing the system into pieces, analyzing project goals, breaking down what needs to be created, and engaging users to define requirements.\n\nDesign\nIn systems design, functions and operations are described in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, and other documentation. Modular design reduces complexity and allows the outputs to describe the system as a collection of subsystems.\n\nThe design stage takes as its input the requirements already defined. For each requirement, a set of design elements is produced.\n\nDesign documents typically include functional hierarchy diagrams, screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudo-code, and a complete data model with a data dictionary. These elements describe the system in sufficient detail that developers and engineers can develop and deliver the system with minimal additional input.\n\nTesting\nThe code is tested at various levels in software testing. Unit, system, and user acceptance tests are typically performed. Many approaches to testing have been adopted.\n\nThe following types of testing may be relevant:\n\nPath testing\nData set testing\nUnit testing\nSystem testing\nIntegration testing\nBlack-box testing\nWhite-box testing\nRegression testing\nAutomation testing\nUser acceptance testing\nSoftware performance testing\nTraining and transition\nOnce a system has been stabilized through testing, SDLC ensures that proper training is prepared and performed before transitioning the system to support staff and end users. Training usually covers operational training for support staff as well as end-user training.\n\nAfter training, systems engineers and developers transition the system to its production environment.\n\nOperations and maintenance\nMaintenance includes changes, fixes, and enhancements.\n\nEvaluation\nThe final phase of the SDLC is to measure the effectiveness of the system and evaluate potential enhancements.\n\nLife cycle\nManagement and control\n\nSDLC phases related to management controls\nSDLC phase objectives are described in this section with key deliverables, a description of recommended tasks, and a summary of related control objectives for effective management. It is critical for the project manager to establish and monitor control objectives while executing projects. Control objectives are clear statements of the desired result or purpose and should be defined and monitored throughout a project. Control objectives can be grouped into major categories (domains), and relate to the SDLC phases as shown in the figure.\n\nTo manage and control a substantial SDLC initiative, a work breakdown structure (WBS) captures and schedules the work. The WBS and all programmatic material should be kept in the \"project description\" section of the project notebook.[clarification needed] The project manager chooses a WBS format that best describes the project.\n\nThe diagram shows that coverage spans numerous phases of the SDLC but the associated MCD[clarification needed] shows mappings to SDLC phases. For example, Analysis and Design is primarily performed as part of the Acquisition and Implementation Domain, and System Build and Prototype is primarily performed as part of delivery and support.\n\nWork breakdown structured organization\n\nWork breakdown structure\nThe upper section of the WBS provides an overview of the project scope and timeline. It should also summarize the major phases and milestones. The middle section is based on the SDLC phases. WBS elements consist of milestones and tasks to be completed rather than activities to be undertaken and have a deadline. Each task has a measurable output (e.g., analysis document). A WBS task may rely on one or more activities (e.g. coding). Parts of the project needing support from contractors should have a statement of work (SOW). The development of a SOW does not occur during a specific phase of SDLC but is developed to include the work from the SDLC process that may be conducted by contractors.\n\nBaselines\nBaselines[clarification needed] are established after four of the five phases of the SDLC, and are critical to the iterative nature of the model. Baselines become milestones.\n\nfunctional baseline: established after the conceptual design phase.\nallocated baseline: established after the preliminary design phase.\nproduct baseline: established after the detail design and development phase.\nupdated product baseline: established after the production construction phase.",

The two powers promised each other support in case of attack by Russia. Also, each state promised benevolent neutrality to the other if one of them was attacked by another European power (generally taken to be France, even more so after the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894). Bismarck saw the alliance as a way to prevent the isolation of the German Empire, which had just been founded a few years before, and to preserve peace, as Russia would not wage war against both empires.\n\nFormation\nWhen Austria-Hungary and Germany formed an alliance in 1879, it was one of the more surprising alliances of its time. Though both shared the German language and a similar culture, Austria-Hungary and Germany were often driven apart, most notably during the recent Austro-Prussian War.

He was based out of the Holy Family Boxing Club in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and later switched to the Smithboro Club in County Monaghan, Ireland. In a double international match against an experienced Polish team in 2007, the Irish team lost 12\u20136 overall; Fury, however, was victorious in both his fights in Rzesz\u00f3w and Bia\u0142ystok. In another Irish match against the US, Fury won his bout by knockout. He won bronze at the AIBA Youth World Boxing Championships in 2006.\n\nIn England, while representing Jimmy Egan's Boxing Academy in Wythenshawe, Manchester, he participated in the senior national championships in 2006 but was beaten by David Price 22\u20138. In May 2007, he won the EU Junior Championship, defeating Istvan Bernath in the final. In July 2007 he won silver at the European Junior Championship, losing to Maxim Babanin in the final.\n\nAs a junior, Fury was ranked number three in the world behind the Russians Maxim Babanin and Andrey Volkov, but did not get the chance to represent Great Britain at the 2008 Olympics because each country is restricted to one boxer per weight division and David Price was selected. Price came up through the amateur Olympic programme. Fury also unsuccessfully tried to qualify for Ireland. Speaking in 2011, Fury said \"I should have gone to the Olympic games in 2008 and won a gold medal for Ireland, but I was denied the chance to go and do it\" He was also forced to withdraw from the Irish national championships after officials from the Holy Trinity Boxing Club in West Belfast, the club of the then Irish amateur heavyweight champion, submitted a protest regarding his eligibility as he was not born in Ireland.\n\nFury won the ABA super-heavyweight title in 2008 by defeating Damien Campbell 19:1. He turned professional later that year. Feeling disillusioned with amateur boxing, he decided not to wait for the 2012 Olympics. He finished with an amateur record of 31\u20134 (26 KOs).",

            "context": "In the mathematical area of graph theory, a clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. That is, a clique of a graph  G is an induced subgraph of  G that is complete. Cliques are one of the basic concepts of graph theory and are used in many other mathematical problems and constructions on graphs. Cliques have also been studied in computer science: the task of finding whether there is a clique of a given size in a graph (the clique problem) is NP-complete, but despite this hardness result, many algorithms for finding cliques have been studied.\n\nAlthough the study of complete subgraphs goes back at least to the graph-theoretic reformulation of Ramsey theory by Erd\u0151s & Szekeres (1935), the term clique comes from Luce & Perry (1949), who used complete subgraphs in social networks to model cliques of people; that is, groups of people all of whom know each other. Cliques have many other applications in the sciences and particularly in bioinformatics.",

I-95 was made a continuous freeway in 2018, and thus I-70 remains the only original Interstate with a discontinuity.\n\nI-95 was discontinuous in New Jersey because of the cancellation of the Somerset Freeway. This situation was remedied when the construction of the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project started in 2010 and partially opened on September 22, 2018, which was already enough to fill the gap.\n\nHowever, I-70 remains discontinuous in Pennsylvania, because of the lack of a direct interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike at the eastern end of the concurrency near Breezewood. Traveling in either direction, I-70 traffic must exit the freeway and use a short stretch of US-30 (which includes a number of roadside services) to rejoin I-70. The interchange was not originally built because of a legacy federal funding rule, since relaxed, which restricted the use of federal funds to improve roads financed with tolls. Solutions have been proposed to eliminate the discontinuity, but they have been blocked by local opposition, fearing a loss of business.",
