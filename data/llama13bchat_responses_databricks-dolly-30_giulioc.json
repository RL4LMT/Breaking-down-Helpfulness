Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United saw them finish at the top of the table for the bulk of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303), Everton (2004\u201305) and Tottenham Hotspur (2009\u201310) \u2013 each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002\u201303 season, who finished third.\n\nFollowing the 2003\u201304 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as it became the first, and to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.\n\nIn May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that \"Top Four\" dominance threatened the division: \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\" Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"\n\nBetween 2005 and 2012 there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only \"Top Four\" clubs reaching that stage.

Leeds United were the only non-\"Top Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000\u201301 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308, and 2008\u201309, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002\u201303 and La Liga in 1999\u20132000).\n\nAdditionally, between the 1999\u20132000 and 2009\u201310 seasons, four Premier League sides reached UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006) and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.\n\nAlthough the group's dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all-time Premier League points won they remain clear by some margin.

He was officially credited with at least five aerial victories.\n\nBorn in Wellington, Browne was a university student when he joined the RNZAF in March 1941. Once his flight training in New Zealand was completed, he proceeded to the United Kingdom to serve with the Royal Air Force. He was posted to No. 485 Squadron in early 1942 but was shot down later in the year over Germany-occupied France. With the help of the French Resistance he avoided the Germans and made his way to the south of France. He was caught when crossing the border into Vichy France and was interned for several weeks. He escaped captivity and eventually back to the United Kingdom. He was transferred to the Middle East where he ferried aircraft before being posted to No. 93 Squadron. He flew Supermarine Spitfires in the Tunisian campaign and in the Allied invasion of Sicily, shooting down a number of German aircraft before being rested in December 1943. After a spell on instructing duties he returned to operational flying with No. 485 Squadron during the final stages of the war in Europe. He briefly commanded the squadron before it was disbanded in August 1945.\n\nReturning to civilian life after the war, he returned to his university studies, becoming a chemist. He briefly served in the New Zealand Territorial Air Force and later became a farmer and then a teacher. He died in 2011, aged 91, at Tauranga.",

        "generated_response": "Baking the perfect flourless cheesecake can be a challenging task, but with the right techniques and ingredients, you can create a delicious and creamy dessert that will impress your guests. Here are some tips to help you bake the perfect flourless cheesecake:\n\n1. Choose the right ingredients: A good flourless cheesecake should have a rich, creamy texture, so it's important to use high-quality ingredients like heavy cream, butter, and a mix of soft and sharp cheeses.\n2. Preheat your oven: Preheating your oven to the right temperature is crucial for baking a perfect flourless cheesecake. The ideal temperature range is between 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n3. Use a water bath: A water bath helps to regulate the temperature of your oven and ensures that your cheesecake cooks evenly. You can use a baking sheet or a springform pan as a water bath.\n4. Don't overmix the batter: Overmixing the batter can result in a dense and dry cheesecake. Mix the ingredients just until they are combined, then stop.\n5. Bake slowly: Bake your cheesecake at a low temperature (around 325\u00b0F or 160\u00b0C) for a longer period of time (around 45-50 minutes). This will help the cheesecake cook evenly and prevent it from cracking.\n6. Use a gentle touch: When you're baking a flourless cheesecake, it's important to be gentle when handling the batter. Avoid any vigorous mixing or stirring, as this can cause the cheesecake to collapse or develop cracks.\n7. Don't open the oven door too often: Opening the oven door too often can cause the cheesecake to sink or develop cracks. Try to limit your visits to the oven to check on the cheesecake.\n8. Use a springform pan: A springform pan is ideal for baking flourless cheesecakes, as it allows for easy release of the cheesecake once it's cooked.\n9. Don't overbake: The perfect flourless cheesecake should be set and slightly jiggly in the center. Overbaking can cause the cheesecake to dry out and become too firm.\n10. Cool slowly: Once your cheesecake is baked, let it cool slowly in the oven for 1-2 hours before removing it. This will help the cheesecake set properly and prevent it from cracking.\n\nBy following these tips, you can bake a perfect flourless cheesecake that's creamy, smooth, and delicious. Good luck!"
