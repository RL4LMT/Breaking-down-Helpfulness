In contrast, processes that focus on the flow of material and energy as they approach equilibria are best analyzed using the disciplines of fluid mechanics and transport phenomena. Disciplines within the field of mechanics need to be applied in the presence of fluids or porous and dispersed media. Materials engineering principles also need to be applied, when relevant.\n\nManufacturing in the field of process engineering involves an implementation of process synthesis steps. Regardless of the exact tools required, process engineering is then formatted through the use of a process flow diagram (PFD) where material flow paths, storage equipment (such as tanks and silos), transformations (such as distillation columns, receiver/head tanks, mixing, separations, pumping, etc.) and flowrates are specified, as well as a list of all pipes and conveyors and their contents, material properties such as density, viscosity, particle-size distribution, flowrates, pressures, temperatures, and materials of construction for the piping and unit operations.",

Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship. Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture\".\n\nWright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture and also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City, his vision for urban planning in the United States. He also designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and other commercial projects. Wright-designed interior elements (including leaded glass windows, floors, furniture and even tableware) were integrated into these structures. He wrote several books and numerous articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as \"the greatest American architect of all time\". In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nRaised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago, briefly with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, and then with Louis Sullivan at Adler & Sullivan. Wright opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 and established a studio in his Oak Park, Illinois home in 1898. His fame increased and his personal life sometimes made headlines: leaving his first wife Catherine Tobin for Mamah Cheney in 1909; the murder of Mamah and her children and others at his Taliesin estate by a staff member in 1914; his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel (m. 1923\u20131927); and his courtship and marriage with Olgivanna Lazovi\u0107 (m. 1928\u20131959).",

            "response": "Sci-fi movies can be graded by many different dimensions to determine \"the best\".  The largest universe market cap for a sci fi universe is Star Wars created by George Lucas and all its canon. Star Wars at its core story is about an all binding energy called the force which bound the galaxy together which a few people could harness its power.  Its a classic story of good vs evil paired with amazing special effects to give the viewer an immersive believable universe.  One of the longest running Sci Fi Series with a cult following was Stargate SG-1 which aired for 10 seasons and had two movies created.    Stargate SG-1 is about a network of inter-planetary gates that allowed for anyone to instantaneously travel between entire different planets.  The saga is ripe with discovering new cultures in foreign planets, intermixed with long story arcs about formidable foes and a team with a very diverse set of people and aliens battling for good of the galaxy.  Stargate SG-1 had amazing character development over its 10 season course which made it a great fan favorite.  The 2004 remake of Battlestar Galactica is an epic story of artificial intelligence versus humanity.  Humanity is being hunted and on the brink of all out extinction.  Its a war-time classic that explores the factors that make us human, what a society is about, and survival.",

Weapon - Whip it back and forth as a flail or throw it to dent someone's skull.\n4. Door stop - hold the door open by wedging it between the door and frame.\n5. Compass - magnetize the frame and never get lost again!",

It's easy to say that Tyson Fury would have the reach advantage due to his height being just under 7 feet, but if I had to pick one I would pick Mike Tyson due to the sheer ferocity of his boxing skills. \n\nMike Tyson would probably seek to cause a lot of body damage with his signature hooks to the liver and use Fury's long gait to sneak inwards for body shots. It would be interesting to see how Fury is able to limit the body damage caused by Mike by using his world-renowned reflexes. \n\nI must still say that it would be a very close fight as both of them are greats of the boxing world!",
