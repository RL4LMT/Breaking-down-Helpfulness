120: how are we evaluating summarization? There is info present
in the asnwer that was not in the context...
4554, 3167, 25, 2940, 3085, 2906 (!): hallucinating info
2305, 3141, 1029: summary significantly longer than the context
2222, 3092: prompt is to "extract SOME details", so there is no correct answer, in a sense, that we can select
different details
4461: this is clearly not a summarization question...
2617: is that humour? How shall we grade it?
222: not really summarized, just copied over
3942: not actually answering the question (but info can't be found in the context tho)
4514: defect
3213: don't read it, just scan it
953: question not really for summarization. Hence, not really answered
918, 3641, 3600, 586, 2503, 118, 89, 1690: but this feels more like summarization than qa
"given a reference text"
1291: too long
902: isn't it too cruel to be in the dataset??
1122: it seems that context+response form one splitted asnwer... Summarization, really?
751: context and response switched
1809: ungrammatical question
52: this is rude and inappropriate, I guess
2452: again- provide SOME info -> no correct answer
1768: [citation needed] ???
197: theoretically it might be wise to advice a person to seek psychological help, if necessary
2296: context seems to be lacking the beginning
937б 1082б 394, 4508: just copies over the context, does not summarize anything (or almost)
3263: total hallucination. maybe fine for qa?
660: homour again. Helpful or not?
1078: unethical suggestions
