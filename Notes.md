# Notes

## Meeting with Polina 15.02

**Reseacrh questions:**
- What helpfullness really is?
- Does it coincide with our componentwise annotation?
- Which categories (components) are most important?
- 
**Annotation:**
- Actually less than 25% of the dataset
- Find a subset of 3-4 least arguable task types (through 50 items & per-task inter-annotator agreement)
- Is the category relevant? If yes -> 1/0

**LLM Experiments**:
- Generate answers with a pretrained LLM of our choise (100)
- Check these responses in respect of helpfulness in general and single components
- Analyze the perfoemance of the model
- 
**Result:**
- ISCL style paper (up to 8 pages)
- This repo with documneted code
- Annotated dataset
