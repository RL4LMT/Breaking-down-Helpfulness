## Guide

In this repository you will find the data and code used in our work about Breaking down Helpfulness for LLMs:

- [`data`](https://github.com/RL4LMT/Breaking-down-Helpfulness/tree/main/data) contains different splits of the `dolly-databricks-15k` dataset used in the study, together with our own IDs*.
- [`annotation`](https://github.com/RL4LMT/Breaking-down-Helpfulness/tree/main/annotation) contains the annotated data (CSV) used for the study, mapped through our IDs.
- [`code`](https://github.com/RL4LMT/Breaking-down-Helpfulness/tree/main/code) contains some data wrangling scripts as well as the R functions used for the statistical analysis and plots. It also includes the code to calculate inter-annotator agreement.
- [`figures`](https://github.com/RL4LMT/Breaking-down-Helpfulness/tree/main/figures) contains the R-generated PDFs with the plots, and PNG files where those figures were further edited.

* IDs mentioned in the paper do not correspond to these but to the entry number in the original dataset.
